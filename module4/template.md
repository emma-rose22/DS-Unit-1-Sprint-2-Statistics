# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
I care about how shipwrecks are both really exciting to discover, that it can be done by the average citizen, and that you can learn a lot about history and culture with each wreck discovered. 

What do you know about?
I am not an expert, but I know that there are thousands of shipwrecks from the last few thousand years scattered around the globe, some of which are located and some there is just an awareness that they sunk and should remain preserved. 

What decisions do you face?
I need to decide which database to use, because there are several. People seeking shipwrecks need to choose how likely they are to find a certain wreck using the data. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
I can focus on shipwrecks in certain areas, for example there are many shipwrecks in the Carribean, but in the Red Sea there are shipwrecks being discovered from Greek times. 

2. Trend related to the news
Sometimes famous shipwrecks make the news, for example when Blackbeard's pirate ship was found and excavated. 

3. Who does that?
Most of the people who wrecked their ships were merchants, pirates, or military personell. 

4. Answering a question people care about
What information has been preserved in these wrecks? Are they accessable by people with a boat and SCUBA certification?

5. Valuable to businesses
There have been several shipwrecks where bottles of wine were found, still good 300 years later, and sold for about a million a bottle. On top of that, even an individual could create a following investigating and uncovereing a ship. A television show could be created out of it. To the despair of science, one could sell historical pieces from the wreck for a high price. 

6. What's the most popular?
Pirates are always at halloween parties. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
I am not sure how to interpret this question. You could make money from sensationalizing a wreck, and maybe money from what the wreck holds. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
A lot of people think shipwrecks are rare, but there are thousands from many different time periods. Depending on the conditions the wrecks can be preserved quite well. A lot of people don't realize that wrecks can be accessable to people without a degree or a badge, just someone who has enough privilage to own a boat and a good chunk of free time. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I would love to tell people about the accessability of shipwrecks, their variety, and how data is used to locate them. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Can you find a lost ship?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I could look at shipwrecks for the possible monetary and historical value.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Searching for ancient burial grounds is less sensational but the same concept, on land. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
There are some nautical websites tracking this data, universities might have data on older shipwrecks. 

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
I care about efforts being made to restore environmental damage. Climate change is devastating, but it is hard for people to maintain optimisim and attention if they think there is no hope. Focusing on effective restoration, where it can be applied, and the urgency is at this point, in my opinion, more effective than telling people the world will end soon. 

What do you know about?
There are several countries and states that are effectively implementing technology and policies to reduce carbon emissions and pollution. 

What decisions do you face?
Due to how large this issue is, I need to focus on an area or method of attack. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
There is certainly a very large geographical variety of what government is making changes to prevent environmental impact. For example recently Britain had the first week in history where it used more renewable resources for energy than coal, which is amazing and shows that all governments can make big change. However, there is currently a smog crisis in India so great that people are being told not to leave their homes(which are also not safe). 

2. Trend related to the news
This is constantly in the news, to the point where I feel I must make a lot of effort to be origional. It is in the news because our best scientists across the globe have told us we now have 11 years to make a change before global warming is on an irreversible path. 

3. Who does that?
Governments mostly, it is hard for individuals to create policy change. 

4. Answering a question people care about
Some people really really care about this, and some people really don't. I hope to show people who feel overwhelmed by climate change and are ignoring it, to see there truly is a chance to prevent this and it is as easy as installing new energy sources and having government policy geared more towards the good of our species rather than making dolla billz. 

5. Valuable to businesses
Developed countries making a shift towards renewable energy are getting a large increase in well paying jobs that will remain in place for decades. New technology and infrastructure is needed to make large change. While money may be lost in some sense, there will also be a new, thriving industry. 

6. What's the most popular?
This is both popular and unpopular to talk about, like Donald Trump. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
Again, not sure how to see this question. There will be profit created by investing in renewable energy, and maybe some lost by forcing companies to use less of certain pollutants and chemicals. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
There are too many misconceptions to list, from not beliving in climate change at all to thinking that using a renewable bag and metal straw will save the world. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
This is a topic that inspires and saddens me. I would like to show people that we can stop the world from becoming increasingly uninhabitable. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Instead of creating renewable energy sources, everyone in the world could eat little to no meat. Cutting out carbon emissions from energy and transportation is equal to the carbon emissions prevented by everyone become a vegetarian (or near vegetarian). 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
There are many ways to combat climate change, but a few key things create the most pollution and emissions. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
It would be a disgrace to ignore this topic for a similar one. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
